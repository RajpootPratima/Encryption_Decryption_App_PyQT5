# Encryption_Decryption_App_PyQT5
An windows/ios/linux based application built using PyQT5 GUI. Just to encrypt and decrypt the file

It is basically a demo to showcase PyQt5 based GUI application where we are using files upload via button click and browse through the files and encrypt them or decrypt them.

NOTE: I have commented out first few lines where encryption key is generated because we need to generate that once only and after that we can use the same key for both encryption. So if any one is using it first time you need to uncomment the code and then comment out as u might lose your encryption key and cannot decrypt you file which is encrypted using different key.
